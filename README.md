# Autonomous-Flight-Controller

I was working on the slam stimulation of the Aerial Autonomous vehicle.
• Detection of the flight path and Object space edges are main task using VGA camera. We were working on RVIZ operated on ROS on LINUX.
• Our main task was to create 2D plane which could stimulate the path of Flight and create a model of flight Space.
• This was a final year project of Electrical Dept led by Seniors Faculty and Students.
